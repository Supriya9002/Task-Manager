Certainly! Creating a simple Model-View-Controller (MVC) project using Express is a great way to practice structuring your code and understanding how different components interact. Here's a suggestion for a basic MVC project:

Project: Task Manager
Objective: Build a simple task manager where users can add, view, and delete tasks.

Project Structure:
Models:

Create a Task model that represents a task with properties like id, title, description, createdAt, etc. This model will handle the logic related to tasks.
Views:

Create EJS templates for rendering HTML views. You can have views for displaying the list of tasks, adding a new task, and viewing details of a task.
Controllers:

Create a TasksController that handles the logic for managing tasks.
Define methods in the controller for handling routes like displaying all tasks, showing a form to add a new task, processing form submissions, and deleting tasks.
Routes:

Set up Express routes to map URL paths to the appropriate controller methods. For example:
GET /tasks should display a list of tasks.
GET /tasks/new should show a form for adding a new task.
POST /tasks should handle the form submission to add a new task.
GET /tasks/:id should display details of a specific task.
POST /tasks/:id/delete should handle deleting a task.
Server:

Set up an Express server to handle incoming requests.
Use middleware for parsing request bodies and serving static files (CSS, images, etc.).
Connect routes to the corresponding controller methods.
Project Workflow:
Displaying Tasks:

Implement the route and controller method to display a list of tasks on the homepage.
Adding Tasks:

Create a route to display a form for adding a new task.
Implement the corresponding controller method to handle the form submission and add a new task.
Viewing Task Details:

Implement a route and controller method to display details of a specific task when its link is clicked.
Deleting Tasks:

Add functionality to delete tasks. This can be achieved by having a delete button next to each task in the list.
Note:
For simplicity, you can store tasks in an array in memory instead of using a database.
Focus on the structure and separation of concerns (MVC), and you can later enhance the project by adding more features or integrating a database.
This project should provide a good hands-on experience with Express, EJS, and the MVC architecture.
